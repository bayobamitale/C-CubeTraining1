		<h1>JavaScript Operations</h1>
		<p>
			JavaScript can be used to declare variables to be operated upon by operators like +, -, *, %, =, e.t.c
		</p>
		<p>
			Variables are containers to hold or store data.
			These variables are called operands when operated on by operators.
			For example, you can declare variables firstNumber and secondNumber and assign values to each using the let keyword and the assignment operator as follows:
			<pre>
				let firstNumber = 20;
				let secondNumber = 30;
				let sum = 0;
			</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			Expression narrates the relationship between the operands and their operators. Example:
			<pre>
				sum = firstNumber + secondNumber
			</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			Statement is a terminated expression. Example:
			<pre>
				sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
			</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			A block is a collection of statements to achieve a specific task. This collection of statements are usually enclosed in curly braces.
			Example of block that adds two numbers together and prints the result:
			<pre>
				function Add()
				{
					let firstNumber = 20;
					let secondNumber = 30;
					let sum = 0;
					sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
					window.alert(sum);
				}
			</pre>
		</p>
		<p id="result">
		</p>		
		<p>
			<script>
				function Add()
				{
					let firstNumber = 20;
					let secondNumber = 30;
					let sum = 0;
					sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
					document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = "The displayed sum of two numbers is: " + sum;
					window.alert(sum);					
				}
				
			</script>
		</p>
	</body>
